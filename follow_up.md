# ETAL-R validation

## previous ETAL validation
Analysis performed from January 2015 to July 2016.
Etal shape: (18001, 36000)

- ETAL versus ground truth (indirect comparison with MODIS)

ETAL satellite pixel closest to the ground station is selected
- ETAL versus MODIS: temporal domain

For a given station, a 10kmx10km (approximately) box is defined around the station. Valid albedo values of the selected pixels are averaged.
- ETAL versus MODIS: spatial domain

For each pixel, at each date the bias between both ETAL and MODIS products is calculated to create a vector of bias values extending over the period of concern. This vector is then averaged and the mean bias is displayed at the corresponding pixel on the spatial map.


## Period of availability
- MTAL-R (LSA-150): from 2004-01 to 2015-12
- ETAL (LSA-103): from 2015-01
- ETAL-R: not yet
